 I am currently an Information Security Manager, leading a team of security practitioners, data scientists and software engineers to provide security insights and automation with the goal of understanding enterprise security gaps and risk. 
 
 I have experience working at the intersection of security and AI, developing and operationalizing machine learning key differentiator solutions in security operations, vulnerability management and endpoint protection. I operate in a wide spectrum of security, data and software with a dash of math. My USP is working cross-functionally to help security teams succeed in adopting data driven practices to deliver business value for security product R&D teams and enterprise security teams. I give back to the cybersecurity community by sharing my work at conferences and supporting women in cybersecurity through podcasting and mentoring. 

I'd like to thank the following people for all that I have in my life
1. The Ravindras: For letting me be my own person
2. Arun Kannawadi: For being the best teammate in the journey of life
3. Robert Freeman: For giving me my first opportunity in cybersecurity and believing in me
